# DIY-Pinterest-Automator
Pinterest pin generator and posting automation project.
This script generates and posts DIY ideas to Pinterest using Amazon affiliates


# Overview
This repository contains a personal automation script designed to streamline the creation and sharing of DIY (Do-It-Yourself) project ideas on Pinterest. The tool leverages trends from sources like Google Trends or Pinterest's own data to generate original, SEO-optimized content ideas, descriptions, and visuals. It then sources relevant materials via APIs (such as Amazon's Product Advertising API) and programmatically posts Pins to Pinterest boards using the Pinterest API v5.
The primary goal is to assist content creators in efficiently building and curating DIY-focused boards, promoting creativity and resourcefulness in areas like home decor, crafts, and sustainable projects. This is a hobbyist tool for individual use, emphasizing ethical practices: all content is original, affiliate disclosures are included where applicable, and API usage complies with platform terms to avoid spam.

# Features
Trend-Based Idea Generation: Pulls current DIY trends and uses AI (e.g., via OpenAI API) to create unique project ideas with SEO-friendly titles and descriptions.
Image Creation: Generates attractive, hooking images for Pins using free AI tools like Stable Diffusion.
Product Sourcing: Searches for required materials from e-commerce APIs, embedding affiliate links responsibly.
Automated Posting: Uses Pinterest's API to create and schedule Pins, with rate limiting to respect platform guidelines.
Compliance Focus: Includes built-in disclosures for affiliates (e.g., #ad) and privacy handling as per the linked policy.

# Motivation
As a tech enthusiast exploring automation, I built this to save time on manual content creation while experimenting with API integrations. It's not intended for commercial scaling or bulk spamming—usage is limited to personal accounts.

# Privacy and Terms
This tool does not collect or store personal data beyond API authentication for the owner's account. See our Privacy Policy for details. All integrations adhere to Pinterest's Developer Terms and Amazon Associates policies.
